## This repository contains functional programming problems and solutions using Racket

### What is Racket?

Racket is a general-purpose programming language as well as the worldâ€™s first ecosystem for developing and deploying new languages.

### Getting started with Racket!
You can find the full information [here](https://docs.racket-lang.org/getting-started/index.html), but here's the summary
 1. Download and Install Racket, get it [here](http://racket-lang.org/download/)
 2. Once installed launch Dr. Racket
 
 1. On Windows, you can start DrRacket from the Racket entry in the Start menu.
 2. On Mac OS, double click on the DrRacket icon. It is probably in a Racket folder that you dragged into your Applications folder.
 3. On Unix (including Linux), the drracket executable can be run directly from the command-line if it is in your path, which is probably the case if you chose a Unix-style distribution when installing.
